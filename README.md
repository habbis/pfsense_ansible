# pfsense ansible playbook 

Here is the upstream [ansible-pfsense](https://github.com/opoplawski/ansible-pfsense) the only change is adding tasks so this modules works
for me i had problems using ansible galaxy collections.

- Ansible variables ansible found in  [here](group_vars/all)

- Task found [here](roles)

- master playbook found here [here](site.yml)
